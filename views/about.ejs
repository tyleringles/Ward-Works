<h1>About Ward Works</h1>

<p>
  Ward Works is a simple web app to help leaders keep track of ward members
  and attendance. It lets you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Store basic contact info for each member</li>
  <li>Record who was present on a given date</li>
  <li>View summaries of past attendance</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This page could be expanded later with more details about the purpose of the
  system and how it fits into real ward workflows.
